# TAGTAG - Personal Management App

One of the reasons why I adore coding is that you can build applications that you need without looking for an online or mobile version that is either paid or full of ads. As someone who likes making her life easier and better, I aimed to help myself through this project.

## The problem - Life is a stream of data

Once my friend said “Life is a stream of data” which is proving itself right every day. There is new information on every website, mobile application, everywhere we are looking at, also we receive new information from everyone we talk to. To give a few examples of the things that I currently need to remember, I can list:
online courses to check, 
Christmas gift inspirations that I came across Pinterest, 
Netflix show that another friend recommended, 
the concert that I saw on a poster on street, 
my mother’s new curry recipe, 
my appointment for the Covid booster shot, 
grocery shopping.

To deal with all of this information, I use several different mobile and web applications: iCalender, Google Calendar, Notion. I also keep a traditional paper agenda.
